# Task Scape Mobile Application
Task Scape is a simple JavaScript project that functions like a to-do list, but allows anyone with the link to write and remove content that directly takes changes across every user. It's perfect for collaborative projects or team-based activities where multiple people need to add, edit, or remove items from a shared list.
